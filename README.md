# odin-recipes
First Project for The Odin Project

This assignment served as a review of all the basic HTML and Git concepts I've learned in the past few days.

The basic website is a recipe site with 3 distinct recipes. Each of these recipe pages have their own images, ordered lists, and unordered lists.

I've tried to commit for each step outlined in the Odin Project lesson. Without CSS, I tried to make the webpage as readable as possible.
